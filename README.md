## Introduction
Dakota's Pomodoro Timer is a simple time-management application based on the Pomodoro Technique, which helps improve focus and productivity. It includes a 25-minute session and a 10-minute session, allowing users to efficiently use their time while solving problems or working on tasks. The Pomodoro technique helps mitigate fatigue and burnout by segmenting work into focused intervals with breaks.

## Troubleshooting & FAQs

### **Q1: The alarm sound is not playing.**
âœ… Ensure the file **"alarm.wav"** is in the same folder as the script.  
âœ… Check if your system audio is enabled and volume is up.  
âœ… Reinstall `playsound` using:


pip install playsound


### **Q2: Can I change the session durations?**
âœ… The default session times are **25 minutes** and **10 minutes**, but you can modify the script by changing:


start_timer(25*60)  # Change 25 to your preferred minutes  
start_timer_10(10*60)  # Change 10 to your preferred minutes
